# Makers Tech Tests

## Bank Test

  Created a small REPL app which creates a bank account with the ability to deposit and withdraw cash, storing the credit, debit, and balance of the account, and prints a full statement of all transactions in a specific format as follows:
  ```
  date || credit || debit || balance
14/01/2012 || || 500.00 || 2500.00
13/01/2012 || 2000.00 || || 3000.00
10/01/2012 || 1000.00 || || 1000.00
```
